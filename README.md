## Conway's Game of Life Simulation

Welcome to the Conway's Game of Life Simulation! This project is a digital recreation of John Conway's famous cellular automaton, the Game of Life. This simulation provides an interactive and visual representation of how simple rules can lead to complex, emergent behavior in a grid-based environment.

### Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input from human players. It consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. The state of the grid evolves over discrete time steps according to a set of simple rules:

-   Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
-   Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
-   Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
-   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

### Features

-   Interactive Grid: Click to toggle cells between alive and dead states to create your initial configuration.
-   Customizable Parameters: Adjust the speed of the simulation.
-   Pattern Presets: Start with predefined patterns such as the Glider, Lightweight Spaceship, and many more.
-   Real-Time Simulation: Watch the evolution of the grid in real-time.
-   Pause/Resume Functionality: Control the simulation with pause and resume options to closely examine each generation.
